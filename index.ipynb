    "Since most usages will be on HPC resources, I <em>highly recommend</em> that you use the `Singularity` definition file in the repository instead of installing the Python module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Singularity:\n",
    " \n",
    " - This is a large image, you will need to set the following environment variables to somewhere other than `/tmp` if you want to avoid memory errors:\n",
    "     - `export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR={YOUR DESTINATION DIR}`\n",
    "     - `export SINGULARITY_LOCALCACHEDIR={YOUR DESTINATION DIR}`\n",
    "     - `export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR={YOUR DESTINATION DIR}`\n",
    "     - `export SINGULARITY_PULLFOLDER={YOUR DESTINATION DIR}`\n",

    "     \n",

    " \n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    " - To run the singularity container interactively, you will need a few flags:\n",
    "     - `-e` flag for a clean environnment upon container start\n",
    "     - `-B` flag to bind your BIDS directory into the container.\n",
    " - Example: \n",
    "     - `singularity shell -e -B <BIDS_DIR>:<SINGULARITY_BIDS_DIR> {Path to singularity .sif}` will start an interactive shell.\n",
    "     - `singualrity exec -e -B <BIDS_DIR>:<SINGULARITY_BIDS_DIR> {Path to singularity .sif} python dwi_pipeline.py` will execute the input python code. See [pipeline](https://axiezai.github.io/pipetography/pipeline.html) for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating your own environment and install `pipetography` as a Python module:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install pipetography`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `pipetography` is a `Nipype` wrapper around `mrtrix3`, `ANTs`, and `FSL`, you have to follow their installation instructions and set them up appropriately on your machine as well:    \n",
    " - [mrtrix3 v3.0.0](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/before_install.html)\n",
