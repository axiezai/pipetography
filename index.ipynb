    "\n",
    " - Currently has pathing issues as seen in the singularity issues page: https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/issues/5040, the 3.6 release candidate should fix this... For now, use docker image if you can. If not, the singularity container will not be able to execute freesurfer `recon-all` step of the workflow. All DWI preprocessing steps will work though.\n",

    " - Obtain the singularity image with `singularity pull docker://axiezai/pipetography:0.2.8` or `singularity build --remote pipetography.sif docker://axiezai/pipetography:0.2.8`. The second option allows you to build remotely via Syslabs Cloud, this will require a remote log tokeen in which you can obtain after registering at https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder. \n",
