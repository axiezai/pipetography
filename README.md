> Nipype and mrtrix3 based pre-/post- processing pipeline for brain diffusion-MRI and generation of structural connectomes of the brain.

The pre-processing pipeline has been updated to reflect what's seen in the optimal [DESIGNER pipeline](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918306827) and on [mrtrix3 cloud apps on brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io). 

The post-processing pipeline, including co-registration of atlases and connectome generation is now included in the [connectomes](https://axiezai.github.io/pipetography/connectomes.html) module

## Install

Since most usages will be on HPC resources, I <em>highly recommend</em> that you use the `Singularity` definition file in the repository instead of installing the Python module.

### Singularity:
 
 - This is a large image, you will need to set the following environment variables to somewhere other than `/tmp` if you want to avoid memory errors:
     - `export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR={YOUR DESTINATION DIR}`
     - `export SINGULARITY_LOCALCACHEDIR={YOUR DESTINATION DIR}`
     - `export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR={YOUR DESTINATION DIR}`
     - `export SINGULARITY_PULLFOLDER={YOUR DESTINATION DIR}`
     
 - Build the singularity image with the `singularity.def` file provided in Github, you will need to have `sudo` permissions to perform singularity build. If you run into memory problems, consider building as a sandbox at first with the `-s` flag. 
     - `sudo singularity build {image_file_name}.sif singularity.def`
     
 - OR pull the built singularity image from cloud library:
    - `singularity pull --arch amd64 library://axiezai/pipetography/pipetography:0.3.9`

### Docker:

 - Docker often encounters permission problems on HPC resources, using the docker container is only recommended if you have `sudo` permissions to the machine. 
 - `docker pull axiezai/pipetography:0.3.9`
 
### Usage:
 - To run the singularity container interactively, you will need a few flags:
     - `-e` flag for a clean environnment upon container start
     - `-B` flag to bind your BIDS directory into the container.
 - Example: 
     - `singularity shell -e -B <BIDS_DIR>:<SINGULARITY_BIDS_DIR> {Path to singularity .sif}` will start an interactive shell.
     - `singualrity exec -e -B <BIDS_DIR>:<SINGULARITY_BIDS_DIR> {Path to singularity .sif} python dwi_pipeline.py` will execute the input python code. See [pipeline](https://axiezai.github.io/pipetography/pipeline.html) for an example.

### Creating your own environment and install `pipetography` as a Python module:

`pip install pipetography`

Since `pipetography` is a `Nipype` wrapper around `mrtrix3`, `ANTs`, and `FSL`, you have to follow their installation instructions and set them up appropriately on your machine as well:    
 - [mrtrix3 v3.0.0](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/before_install.html)
 
 - [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Linux-and-Mac-OS)
     
 - [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation)
  
Everything listed in this section is included in the Singularity and Docker containers.

## The pipeline:

Currently supports acquisitions with no reverse phase encoding (`-rpe_none`)  and reverse phase encoding in all DWI directions (`-rpe_all`) options. See [pipeline](https://axiezai.github.io/pipetography/pipeline.html) for preprocessing details, and [connectomes](https://axiezai.github.io/pipetography/connectomes.html) for postprocessing details.
